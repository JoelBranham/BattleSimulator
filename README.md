This Java application features a grid of "fighting" units. Each turn in battle, adjacent units attempt to move either up, down, left, or right and fight eachother. They deal damage equal to their set
attack power. They are given 25 attack and 100 health by default. The slider at the top of the GUI allows the user to 
select the number of units they wish to start with. To start the game, press "Start Simulation". Use the slider at the top of the GUI to change 
the number of units.
